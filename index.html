      <p>To what shall I compare a month's time<br>
        As not the anniversary of relationship sublime:<br>
        &ensp; One date holds no value on paper,<br>
        &ensp; But rather inside of me.<br>
        &ensp; This month cannot wait until later,<br>
        &ensp; For time does not wait for thee.<br>
        &ensp; With the joy I feel and love's appeal,<br>
        &ensp; I find meaning in words<br>
        &ensp; Towards a meaning I find healed,<br>
        &ensp; To an elegant and loving bird.</p>
